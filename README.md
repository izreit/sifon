
Sifon
=====

Sifon is a metaprogrammable altJS: a language compiled into JavaScript
and featuring rich compile-time metaprogramming facilities (i.e. macros)
alongside of pattern matching, destructuring assignment and more.

In addition to simple macros supported by many other macro-featuring altJS
(e.g. toplevel defined and/or template-based substitions),
Sifon have non-hygienic, lexically scoped macros and symbol macros
integrated with MetaLua-like compile-time code evaluation.
